function sensor_data = calculate_sensor_data_for_mask(pressure_mask,Nx,dx,Ny,dy)
% DESCRIPTION:
% K-Wave generates sensor data from the pressure mask along the x-axis with a linear transducer of
% Nx transducers and dx pitch. Returns a calculated array with transducers
% on the y-axis and the x-axis being a timme stream. 
%
% INPUTS:
% pressure_mask - Calculated based on the tissue mask, concentrations and wavelengths. 
% Nx - Number of X Pixels
% Ny - Number of Y Pixels
% dx - size of each x pixel in meters
% dy - size of each y pixel in meters
%
% OUTPUTS:
% sensor_data - array of (num_transducers, num_time). This represents the data stream from the 
% linear array of transducers. More customization will be added soon to
% increase/decrease time measurement.

% Generates boundary around the grid to prevent wrapping
PML_size = 20;
% Builds kgrid
kgrid = kWaveGrid(Nx, dx, Ny, dy);

% define the properties of the propagation medium
medium.sound_speed = 1540;	% [m/s]
%medium.alpha_coeff = 0.75;       % absorption coefficient [dB/(MHz^y cm)]
%medium.alpha_power = 0.6;        % absorption power y (typically 1â€“2)


% create initial pressure
p0 = smooth(pressure_mask ,true);
% assign to the source structure
source.p0 = p0;

% define a binary line sensor
sensor.mask = zeros(Nx, Ny);
sensor.mask(1, :) = 1;

% create the time array
kgrid.makeTime(medium.sound_speed);

% set the input arguements: force the PML to be outside the computational
% grid; switch off p0 smoothing within kspaceFirstOrder2D
input_args = {'PMLInside', false, 'PMLSize', PML_size, 'Smooth', false, 'PlotPML', false, 'PlotSim', false};


% run the simulation
sensor_data = kspaceFirstOrder2D(kgrid, medium, source, sensor, input_args{:});
